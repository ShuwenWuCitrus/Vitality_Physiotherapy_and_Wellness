## Installation

To set up the Vitality Wellness application on your local machine, this tutorial assumes you have Laragon/XAMPP (Windows) or Valet (macOS):

1. **Clone the Repository on C:\laragon\www**:
    ```bash
    https://github.com/ShuwenWuCitrus/Vitality_Physiotherapy_and_Wellness.git
    cd Vitality_Physiotherapy_and_Wellness
    ```

2. **Use Laragon's Terminal to Install PHP Dependencies**:
    Make sure you have Composer installed. Then run:
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3. **Install JavaScript Dependencies**:
    Make sure you have Node.js and NPM or Yarn installed. Then run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
    Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure your environment variables, especially the database settings.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

5. **Generate Application Key**:
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

6. **Run Database Migrations and Seeders**:
    Ensure your database is set up and configured in the `.env` file. Then run:
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate --seed
    ```

7. **Build Frontend Assets**:
    Use Vite to build the frontend assets:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

## Running the Application

To run the Vitality Wellness application, follow these steps:

1. **Start the Development Server**:
    If you are using Laragon, XAMPP, or Valet, ensure your local server is running. Then start the Laravel development server:
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

2. **Run Vite in Watch Mode**:
    To automatically rebuild frontend assets during development, run Vite in watch mode:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

3. **Access the Application**:
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the URL provided by your local server setup).

Now you should be able to access and interact with the Vitality Wellness application on your local machine.

## Conclusion
